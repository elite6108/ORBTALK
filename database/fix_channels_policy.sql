-- Fix channels SELECT policy to avoid recursion
-- The issue: Channels policy queries server_members, which when joined with channels creates a loop

-- Drop existing channels policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "View channels if member or admin" ON public.channels;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Owner/Admin manage channels" ON public.channels;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view accessible channels" ON public.channels;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Server admins can manage channels" ON public.channels;

-- Simple policy: Allow viewing all channels
-- Access control is handled at the message/server level
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view channels" ON public.channels
  FOR SELECT
  USING (true);

-- Server owners can manage channels (checks servers table, not server_members)
CREATE POLICY "Server owners can manage channels" ON public.channels
  FOR ALL
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM public.servers s
      WHERE s.id = channels.server_id
      AND s.owner_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
